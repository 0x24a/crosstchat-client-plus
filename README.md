# hackchat-client-plus

a tweaked hackchat client. aka hackchat++.
most code from [https://github.com/hack-chat/main].

some of the current features:

- up to date (includes all known features of 2022/10 hack.chat official client)
- open source and safe (no message or password recording)
- defend known latex weapons (malicious latex messages wont be rendered but will be shown in plain text)
- repair the display of yourself's messages (now no matter whether you use a tripcode, you can see the nickname of yourself in a different color from others', if you haven't set a custom nickname color with `/color` or `changecolor` command.)
- custom invite (now you can invite another user to a certain channel decided by you instead of a random channel.)
- fast quote (reply to a certain message by rightclicking the sender's nickname) (thanks to [https://crosst.chat] for this part of code)
